Chewing bytes of code
Chewing each byte of code

----------- To Do --------------
1. Put a favicon on tab, before title
2. 





Code can either be repititive or inefficient. I hate both. But I have a trick.

void performTask(Task* t) {
	if(isBoringTask(t)) {
		Task *t1 = new Task(Write a code to do task t);
		performTask(t1);
	} else {
		DoIt(t);
	}
}

So How I actually make website:
I write a python code (cp1), cp1 generate another efficient python code(cp2), which is used to generate final python code(cp3) & JavaScript code (cj3) [Which will be finally used by server to handle a request]

So finally cp3 (HTML generated by server) or cj3 (HTML generated by JavaScript on browser) are responsible to generate HTML you are seeing in browser.

mslib: It is framework, which does all the cp1->cp2, cp2->cp3, cp2->cj3 tasks.
